# 🦠 Visualization and Analysis of Epidemic Outbreaks  
### A Comparative Study of Ebola (2014–2016) and COVID-19 (2020–2023)

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on the **visual analysis of two major epidemic outbreaks — Ebola and COVID-19**,  
using datasets from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.  
The analysis highlights differences in disease spread, mortality, and global impact using advanced **data visualization** techniques.  

Data preprocessing, transformation, and visual analytics were performed using **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) in **Google Colab**.  
Interactive dashboards and time-series graphs were created to understand temporal and spatial trends of both outbreaks.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Preprocess and clean WHO datasets for Ebola (2014–2016) and COVID-19 (2020–2023)  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends  
- Create **visualizations**: line graphs, bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts, and interactive dashboards  
- Compare the regional, temporal, and global spread of both diseases  
- Interpret and communicate key public-health insights

## 🔄 Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Ebola dataset (2014–2016) from WHO archives  
   - COVID-19 dataset (2020–2023) from WHO global database  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Renamed lengthy variables for readability  
   - Converted date columns to datetime format  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Created features such as *Month–Year* and *Quarter*  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics and distribution summaries  
   - Time-series plots for cases and deaths  
   - Stacked and double bar charts for quarterly trends  
   - Pie charts for top affected countries  
   - Heatmaps showing case intensity by region  

4. **Visualization Tools**  
   - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for static plots  
   - **Plotly** for interactive dashboards

## 📊 Results and Observations  
### 🧬 Ebola (2014–2016)  
- Epicentre: **Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea**  
- Extremely high fatality rate but geographically localized  
- Curves show sharp rise and quick containment by 2016  

### 🌍 COVID-19 (2020–2023)  
- Global multi-wave pandemic with shifting epicentres (US, India, China)  
- Visualization shows recurring infection peaks  
- Wider geographical spread but lower fatality compared to Ebola  

📌 **Comparative Insight:**  
Ebola was intense but localized, whereas COVID-19 was widespread and prolonged.
